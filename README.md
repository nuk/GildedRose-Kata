OEDEPuSS - Gilded Hose
===

This version of the Gilded Hose is complementary of the OEDEPuSS Workshop presented by [Fabricio Buzeto](http://about.buzeto.com). Please follow the steps here described.

The idea of this version of Gilded Rose is to help excercise concepts of code quality in legacy code and is composed by 3 exercises of 30 minutes. To follow the excercises you must checkout the branches of each step inside each block as follows.

As you progress, new instructions will be presented.

First you must clone the repository and make sure your environment is properly set up.

    git clone git@github.com:nuk/GildedRose-Kata.git

B-1-0
======

Your Task, for now is to read this code and try to understand what if wants to accomplish.

Simple right? You have 5 minutes to do that. So hurry up!

----

B-1-1
======

Ready for the next step ?

Just change to the `1-1` branch by running the following command.

    $ git checkout origin/1-1

----

B-2-0
======

This step seems a little ahead of you, but if you must.

Just change to the `2-0` branch by running the following command.

    $ git checkout origin/2-0


----

B-3-0
======

Are you sure you should be at this step?

Who am I to judge you, just go to the `3-0` branch using the following command.

    $ git checkout origin/3-0
